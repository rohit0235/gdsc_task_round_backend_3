# gdsc_task_round_backend_3

## Description

**gdsc_task_round_backend_3** is a JavaScript project developed for a GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) task round, focusing on backend development. This project implements server-side logic, manages database interactions, and provides API endpoints for various operations.

## Features

- **Server-Side Logic**: Efficiently handles incoming requests and sends appropriate responses.
- **Database Interactions**: Connects to a database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring data is stored and retrieved effectively.
- **API Endpoints**: Offers RESTful API endpoints to support various functionalities required by the application.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohit0235/gdsc_task_round_backend_3.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd gdsc_task_round_backend_3
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables, such as database connection strings and API keys.

5. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on the specified port, usually `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/example**: Retrieves example data.
- **POST /api/example**: Creates new example data.
- **PUT /api/example/:id**: Updates example data by ID.
- **DELETE /api/example/:id**: Deletes example data by ID.

*(Update the endpoints based on your actual API routes)*

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **Express** (for server-side framework)
- **Database** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) *(Specify your database here)*

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional API endpoints as required.
- Enhance error handling and validation.
- Optimize performance and security features.
- Add unit and integration tests.
